// A terminal onto a pod - the agent pod, unless told otherwise - modelled on the Claude Harness's.
//
// The harness runs a node-pty per browser socket, and that pty's command is
// `tmux new-session -A` running claude in a loop. There is no server to run one
// here, so the pty comes from Kubernetes instead: the exec subresource gives a
// real TTY in the pod, through Rancher's cluster proxy, authenticated by the
// session cookie the page already has. Everything on the far side of it is the
// same idea, and lives in seed/pod/: tmux for a session that outlives
// the browser tab, and claude looping inside it.
//
// The protocol is `base64.channel.k8s.io`, which is what the dashboard's own
// container shell speaks: each frame is a channel digit followed by base64.
// Channel 0 is stdin, 1 stdout, 2 stderr, 3 error, and 4 carries a JSON
// {Width, Height} on resize.
