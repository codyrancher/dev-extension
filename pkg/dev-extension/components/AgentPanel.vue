<script>
// The panel the global chord opens: several conversations with the agent pod, as tabs.
//
// Inside a tab is PodTerminal, pointed at one conversation in the agent pod.
//
// Two things about the conversations, and they pull in opposite directions on purpose:
//
//   - Which conversations exist, and what they are called, come from the pod. tmux and a
//     directory under /workspace/sessions are where a conversation actually is, so that is what
//     is asked (see agent.ts), which is what makes a second browser tab, a reload and a
//     colleague's session all show the same list with the same names.
//   - Whether this panel is open, where it sits and how big it is come from localStorage. That
//     is one person in front of one browser, and putting it in the pod would mean docking the
//     panel left here docked it left on somebody else's screen. See agent-drawer.ts.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The conversations are a tab row, not a dropdown.
//
// One tab per conversation, click to switch, drag to rearrange - the whole set visible at a
// glance and in whatever order suits, which is what a person wants when they are moving between
// two or three of them. Each tab carries its own controls rather than one shared set acting on
// "the active one": a rename pencil and a close, both appearing on hover (and on keyboard focus,
// so they are reachable without a mouse) in reserved trailing space so a tab does not change
// width as the pointer crosses it. So closing the third conversation does not mean selecting it
// first.
//
// Written out here rather than imported from Rancher's `@shell/components/Tabbed`: that component
// renders a label as escaped text with no slot, so per-tab controls cannot be added to it, and
// it has no notion of a rename box in place of a label. It is a plain flex row instead - no
// `useHash` (a conversation id in the URL would land in Rancher's history), no side-tab mode,
// no extension tabs. The active tab is marked with a background and an underline; the row scrolls
// sideways when there are more tabs than fit, and the new-conversation button rides at its end.
// Dragging one along the row reorders it, and that order is this browser's - see drawer.ts.
