// The chat view of a pane: the same tmux session as the terminal, drawn as messages.
//
// Claude Code's own UI is a terminal one, and it is the one the agent runs in: the login, the
// permission prompts, the questions it asks, the surveys, all of it happens there and needs no
// OAuth of its own. This view does not replace that; it reads it. The transcript claude writes
// is what the messages come from, the pane's last lines are what the prompts come from, and
// what a person types or clicks here goes into the pane as keystrokes. Switching between this
// and the terminal (PodTerminal's toggle) changes nothing about the session.
//
// Reaching the pane: the same way the terminal does. The pane's argv says where it runs - in
// the pod this component is pointed at, or, when it starts with `kubectl exec`, in another pod
// that pod reaches - and every read and write here is a short exec along the same path.

      Getting around: the caret, your messages one by one, and the bottom.

      The caret keys are here rather than on the composer's own row because this is the row of
      things that move you around, and they are two more of those. The terminal's key bar -
      Esc, Tab, Ctrl, home, end, word-delete - is for driving a TUI and is hidden in this view
      (see PodTerminal); what a text box actually wants on a phone is a way to put the caret
      back one character to fix a typo, which is these two and nothing else.

      `@mousedown.prevent` is what makes them work at all: without it the box loses focus on
      the press, the selection collapses, and the arrow moves a caret that is no longer there.
