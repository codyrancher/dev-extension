// What claude is doing, written down by claude itself.
//
// The chat view used to read a conversation's state off the terminal: regexes over the last
// forty lines of a TUI, looking for "esc to interrupt" and a bare prompt. That is guesswork
// about a picture, and it guessed wrong in both directions - "working" hours after claude had
// stopped, because a spinner line was still in the scrollback, and "ready" while it was mid-tool.
//
// Claude Code has hooks for exactly these moments, and this is the one script behind all of
// them. It is registered (claude-defaults.mjs) for:
//
//   SessionStart      claude is up, on this transcript
//   UserPromptSubmit  a turn began, and what it began with
//   Stop              the turn is over
//   Notification      claude is waiting: an idle prompt, a permission prompt, a question
//   SessionEnd        claude exited, and why
//
// Each firing rewrites one small file, `<sessions>/<pane>.state.json`, with the latest event,
// and appends a line to `<pane>.events.jsonl` so a sequence can be read back when something
// looks wrong. The pane is MC_SESSION, which shell.sh puts in claude's environment; the hook
// payload itself only knows the transcript's uuid.
//
// Nothing here is authoritative on its own. The chat crosses it with the transcript (which
// carries the turn boundaries too) and with whether the claude process is alive - a hook can
// only record what claude lived to tell it.
