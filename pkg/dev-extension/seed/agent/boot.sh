# There is nothing to serve here, which is the whole difference between this pod and an
# extension's. It exists so that the terminal a person opens with a chord from any page in
# Rancher has somewhere to exec into, and everything that terminal needs - tmux, the claude CLI,
# kubectl - is installed by /seed/terminal-tools.sh, the same script every extension pod's
# terminal already runs. Sharing it is the point: a second, slightly different install is how
# the agent would end up with a different claude from the ones it is meant to help.
#
# This stays root. An extension pod drops to the node user here because its dev server has to
# own the tree webpack is watching; there is no dev server in this pod, and shell.sh drops each
# pane to the node user itself, so dropping the container's own process would only mean the
# install below could not use apt.

# the loop inside resumes the conversation by its id. Before this, a restart - Rancher's or
# this Deployment's - ended every conversation until somebody opened each one again, and a
# fix left running overnight was found stopped in the morning. Staggered a little: each start
# is a claude coming up.
